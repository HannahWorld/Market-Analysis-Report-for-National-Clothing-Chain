# Market-Analysis-Report-for-National-Clothing-Chain

Sales have been flat for an online national clothing chain. They want to lure lost customers back. They want to advertise specific products to specific customers in specific locations. Some of the products they carry are:

*	Shirt: $25
*	Sweater: $100
*	Leather Bag: $1000

I conducted an analysis to determine the best product to advertise to each customer.

The project uses a variety of data sources, including
## US Census Bureau

* Average Income
* Location
* Population
* Industry
